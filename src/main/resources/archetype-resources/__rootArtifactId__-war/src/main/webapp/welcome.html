        This website contains three different angular apps. The first one is the one you see now (homeapp). No login is required and all views/pages are indexed by searchengines.
        The second one is the angular app you see, when you login as user using this <a href="/user/">link to user section</a> or the Login-Button above (userApp). The third app is the app you see
        when login in the <a href="/admin/">admin section</a> which need administrator rights (adminApp). The content of the user or admin apps are not shown to searchengines, of course.
